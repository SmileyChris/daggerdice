# DaggerDice

A 3D dice rolling web application for tabletop RPGs with Hope/Fear mechanics and optional multiplayer sessions.

## Features

### Core Dice System
- **Hope & Fear Dice**: Roll two D12 dice representing positive (Hope) and negative (Fear) outcomes
- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Optional D6 modifier that adds or subtracts from the total
- **Modifiers**: Numeric bonuses/penalties ranging from -20 to +20
- **Critical Success**: Occurs when Hope and Fear dice show equal values
- **3D Physics**: Realistic dice rolling with gravity, collision, and physics simulation

### Multiplayer Sessions (Optional)
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Share rolls with friends in live sessions
- **Room-based System**: Create or join rooms using simple 6-character codes
- **Shared Roll History**: See everyone's rolls in a combined history
- **URL Sharing**: Invite players by sharing room links
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically falls back to solo mode if multiplayer unavailable

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Roll History**: Track recent rolls with detailed breakdown
- **Toast Notifications**: Live notifications for multiplayer roll updates
- **Theme Support**: Multiple dice themes including "default" and "smooth"

## Game Mechanics

### Dice Rolling
1. **Hope Die**: Green-themed D12 representing positive outcomes
2. **Fear Die**: Red-themed D12 representing negative outcomes
3. **Result Calculation**: Base total = Hope + Fear + Advantage/Disadvantage + Modifier

### Roll Types
- **Standard**: Roll Hope and Fear dice only
- **Advantage**: Add a D6 to the total (green theme)
- **Disadvantage**: Subtract a D6 from the total (red theme)

### Critical Success
When Hope and Fear dice show the same value, the roll is a "Critical Success" regardless of total.

## Multiplayer Sessions

### Creating a Session
1. Click "ðŸŽ² Play with Friends"
2. Enter your player name
3. Click "Create New Room"
4. Share the room URL or 6-character room code with friends

### Joining a Session
1. Visit a shared room URL, or
2. Click "ðŸŽ² Play with Friends"
3. Enter your name and the 6-character room code
4. Click "Join Room"

### Session Features
- **Live Roll Sharing**: All players see each other's rolls in real-time
- **Combined History**: Shared roll history showing all participants
- **Player List**: See who's currently in the room
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for connectivity
- **Easy Exit**: Return to solo mode anytime

## Configuration

### Dice Physics Settings
The 3D dice simulation can be configured in `src/dice-roller-main.ts`:

```typescript
diceBox = new DiceBox({
  container: "#dice-box",
  assetPath: "/assets/",
  theme: "default",
  scale: 10,
  gravity: 1.5,
  mass: 1,
  friction: 0.8,
  restitution: 0.5,
  // ... additional physics settings
});
```

### Session Configuration
Session behavior is managed through environment detection and falls back gracefully when multiplayer features are unavailable.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm start            # Start development server (alias for npm run dev)
npm run dev          # Start frontend and worker development servers with hot reload
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run deploy       # Build and deploy to Cloudflare
npm run verify       # Check deployment status
npm test             # Run all tests
