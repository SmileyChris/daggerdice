## "Whatâ€™s New" (Changelog)

- Click the version label at the bottom-right to see all changes.
- Returning users automatically see new changes since their last visit.

## Browser Requirements

- Modern browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
- WebGL for 3D dice; the app falls back to secure randomness if 3D rendering isnâ€™t available.
- WebSocket for multiplayer; HTTPS is required in production.

## Troubleshooting

- No 3D dice: Ensure WebGL is enabled; the app will still function with random rolls.
- Canâ€™t connect to a room: Check your network and ensure HTTPS if testing outside localhost.
- Audio not playing: Some browsers block autoplay until you interact with the page.
